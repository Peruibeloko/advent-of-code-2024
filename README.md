# Advent of Code 2024

## How to Run
1. Install GHC 9.10 and Cabal
1. `git clone`
1. `cabal build && clear && cabal run aoc2024 -- [day] [part] [puzzle input]`

Where `[puzzle input]` should be a `.txt` file located at the day's folder.

Day 1, part 1 using `src/Day1/input.txt` would be `cabal run aoc2024 -- 1 1 input`
